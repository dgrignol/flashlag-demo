# Flash-Lag Demo

Interactive web experiment that replicates the flash-lag illusion and a disappearing-dot variant. Participants watch a dot move left to right, then click where they believe the target was when a flash appeared (flash-lag mode) or where it vanished (disappearing mode). Results are stored until reset or reload and a leaderboard reveals the most accurate guessers.

**Live demo:** https://dgrignol.github.io/flashlag-demo/

## Features

- Two modes: classic flash-lag (flash at screen centre) and disappearing-dot (no flash, dot vanishes at selected offset).
- Adjustable parameters: motion speed, flash/disappearance offset, flash duration, offsets, dot radius, colours.
- Automatic scaling: canvas resizes to the viewport, keeping trials aligned.
- Immediate feedback: error visualization plus per-participant stats and a leaderboard.
